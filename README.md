# Emerging Technologies 2019 Project
## by Tomas Brazas G00349242

# Project Outline
1. Create a Flask web application that allows users to draw digits on a Canvas.

2. The application should pre-process the drawn image before running it through a trained Model which should return a prediction for the drawn number back to the frontend user.

3. The development of the Model should be documented in a Jupyter Notebook, including clear explanations, documentation and training of the Model.

# Running the application
Requirements:
1. Anaconda
2. Keras
3. Tensorflow 
4. OpenCV

Cmder is suggested but not neccesary.

Steps to run:
1. Make sure Anaconda is updated to atleast 3.7 or newer. If not, type into command prompt: **"conda update --all"
2. To install Keras/Tensorflow type into command prompt: **"conda install -c conda-forge keras tensorflow"
3. Install OpenCV type into command prompt: **"pip install opencv-python"
4. Clone this github repository. 
5. Navigate to the folder using the command prompt, using **"cd Emergingtech2019/web-app"
6. To run the web application using command prompt: **"python web-app.py"
7. Upon running you should be able to access the Web Application on **http://127.0.0.1:5000/ .
